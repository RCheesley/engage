## What is Akeeba Engage

Akeeba Engage is an extension for sites powered by the Joomla!™ CMS. It makes it possible to submit, display and manage user comments on Joomla! core content (articles).

## Downloads and support

You can find the download links at the top of the page.

You can receive community support through the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/akeeba/engage/discussions) of Akeeba Engage's GitHub repository. Kindly note that this is meant to serve as a place where users of Akeeba Engage help each other, in a way similar to how Stack Overflow works. We may pop in from time to time to give an answer — especially at the beginning when the volume of discussions is pretty low — but our involvement in these discussions is not guaranteed. Thank you for your understanding!

## First steps

Akeeba Engage is a Joomla package and uses Joomla core features for most of what it does. Please read the [[Main Concepts]] page to get an idea of how Akeeba Engage puts everything together. Then follow the [[Installation and Setup Guide]] to install Akeeba Engage and set up comments on your site.

You can dive deeper into the available features from the pages listed on the right hand site of this documentation Wiki.

## Joomla 3 and Joomla 4 support

Akeeba Engage 3 is only compatible with Joomla 4. This is the only actively maintained version of our software. New features will be implemented here.

Akeeba Engage 2.x is the last version compatible with Joomla 3. It is in maintenance mode until August 17th, 2023. This means we are not planning on supporting newer PHP versions with it, we are not implementing any new features or doing anything more than the minimum maintenance necessary.

Akeeba Engage 2.x is also compatible with Joomla 4.0 and 4.1 _for the sole purpose of making it possible to upgrade your site to Joomla 4_. Upon upgrading your site to Joomla 4 you must install the latest Akeeba Engage 3 release.
