Listed as “Privacy – Akeeba Engage“ and “Data Compliance – Akeeba Engage“.

Privacy legislation around the world requires you to allow your users to download a copy of the information you have on file for them, as well as request the permanent deletion of that information. This includes comments. Comments are either linked to a user or have a name and email address. In either case they are personally identifiable and covered under GDPR and similar legislation.

Akeeba Engage supports two solutions to that requirement.

# Joomla's built-in Privacy component

You need to enable the “Privacy – Akeeba Engage“ plugin.

Please note that Joomla's Privacy component only works with comments which are submitted by a Joomla user when they are logged in. It does not apply to comments filed as a guest even if the email address used is the same as the one used with a Joomla user. This is a limitation of Joomla. 

If that is a problem for your use case you can use our free of charge [Akeeba DataCompliance](https://github.com/akeeba/com_datacompliance) component and the “Data Compliance – Akeeba Engage” plugin described below.

# Akeeba DataCompliance

You need to enable the “Data Compliance – Akeeba Engage“ plugin.

Unlike the plugin for Joomla's built-in Privacy component, this plugin works on all comments submitted by a logged in user _and_ all comments submitted as a guest using the user's email address. These comments will be exported on demand and pseudonymized when the user decides to delete their user account.
