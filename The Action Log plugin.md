Listed as “Action Log – Akeeba Engage“.

If you have a site with multiple comment manager users it may be important or even mandatory to keep an audit log of who did what and when. Akeeba Engage fully supports Joomla's User Actions Log. Publish this plugin to enable Akeeba Engage's integration with the Joomla User Actions Log.

## Options

**Log comments**. By default Akeeba Engage only logs the administrative functions taken against existing comments. If you enable this option it will also log when a logged in user submit a new comment. Please note that this option is disabled by default to prevent bloating your database.

**Also log guest comments**. Only applies when the “Log comments” option is enabled. When this option is enabled as well Akeeba Engage will log comments submitted by guest users. Please note that this option is disabled by default to prevent bloating your database.

**Log guest unsubscribes**. By default, Akeeba Engage only logs when a logged in user unsubscribes from the comment notifications of an article. When this option is enabled it will also log when a guest user who had submitted a comment unsubscribed from comment notifications. Please note that this option is disabled by default to prevent bloating your database.
