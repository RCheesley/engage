Listed as “Action Log – Akeeba Engage“.

If you have a site with multiple comment manager users it may be important or even mandatory to keep an audit log of who did what and when. Akeeba Engage fully supports Joomla's User Actions Log. Publish this plugin to enable Akeeba Engage's integration with the Joomla User Actions Log.

## Options

**Log comments**. By default Akeeba Engage only logs the administrative functions taken against existing comments. If you enable this option it will also log when a logged in user submit a new comment. Please note that this option is disabled by default to prevent bloating your database.

## Guest user actions are not logged

The User Action Log feature is part of Joomla itself. This plugin merely adds user action records to Joomla's database. Joomla requires a non-zero user ID that corresponds to an existing user account for each user action record. Therefore it is not possible to log actions taken by Guest users.
