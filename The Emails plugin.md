Listed as “Akeeba Engage – Emails“.

Akeeba Engage can send emails under certain circumstances. For example, when a comments administrator needs to moderate a comment or to notify a user for a reply to their ticket.

This plugin makes email sending possible. It needs to be enabled for any emails to be sent at all. If you disable it no emails will be sent.

## Options

**Notify Comment Managers about all comments**. By default, comment managers are only notified when an _unpublished_ comment is submitted. Enabling this option will notify comment managers about all comments, including those which get immediately published.

This option is highly discouraged on most sites. Even on personal blog sites it's typically best to use the Author notification option in the Component options, teh category or the article instead.
