We strive to be an inclusive company. To this end, we take accessibility seriously and try to do our best to apply accessibility principles in the design of Akeeba Engage.

We are using semantic structure for our HTML output and ARIA attributes to clarify the meaning or provide additional context to screen readers as appropriate. We also tried to create a color scheme which should work fairly well with regards to being accessible to people with limited vision and, generally, accessibility requirements regarding visual perception.

We are only human – and we're not accessibility experts.

If you have found an accessibility issue that comes from our code – not Joomla itself or third party extensions – please file an issue on our GitHub repository. We'd appreciate it if you tried to explain the problem and a proposed solution. Thank you in advance!
